# Save/Load System

## Purpose
Portable character profiles that travel across worlds. Characters are independent local JSON files loaded into any session.

## Architecture

### Interfaces
- `ICharacterSaveData` (non-generic) — base for coordinator discovery: `SaveKey`, `LoadPriority`, `SerializeToJson()`, `DeserializeFromJson()`
- `ICharacterSaveData<T>` (generic) — typed contract subsystems implement: `Serialize()`, `Deserialize(T)`
- `IOfflineCatchUp` — macro-simulation catch-up (orthogonal to save/load)
- `ISaveable` — world-scoped saves only (TimeManager, CommunityTracker, etc.)

### Key Classes
- `CharacterDataCoordinator` — orchestrates export/import, lives on root Character GO
- `CharacterProfileSaveData` — the portable profile DTO (characterGuid, originWorldGuid, componentStates, partyMembers, worldAssociations)
- `SaveFileHandler` — atomic async file I/O to `Profiles/{characterGuid}.json` and `Worlds/{worldGuid}.json`
- `CharacterSaveDataHelper` — static JSON bridge for ICharacterSaveData<T>
- `SaveManager` — world save orchestration with `SaveLoadState` enum (Idle/Saving/Loading) and mutual exclusion
- `GameLauncher` — singleton coroutine orchestrator for the full game load sequence
- `ScreenFadeManager` — modular overlay system (ShowOverlay, UpdateStatus, ShowWarning, HideOverlay)
- `GameSessionManager` — session flags, recreated per scene (no DontDestroyOnLoad), static flags survive

### Load Priority Order
| Priority | Systems |
|----------|---------|
| 0 | CharacterProfile |
| 10 | CharacterStats |
| 20 | CharacterSkills, CharacterAbilities |
| 30 | CharacterEquipment |
| 40 | CharacterNeeds, CharacterTraits |
| 50 | CharacterRelation, CharacterBookKnowledge |
| 60 | CharacterParty, CharacterCommunity, CharacterJob, CharacterSchedule |
| 70 | CharacterMapTracker, CharacterCombat |

## GUID-Based World Saves
- World files stored as `Worlds/{worldGuid}.json` (replaces slot-based `world_0.json`)
- `SaveFileHandler.GetAllWorlds()` scans the `Worlds/` directory and returns all available world saves
- `SaveManager.CurrentWorldGuid` and `CurrentWorldName` track the active world at runtime

## WorldAssociation
- `CharacterProfileSaveData.worldAssociations` tracks the character's position per world (keyed by world GUID)
- Updated in `CharacterDataCoordinator.SaveLocalProfileAsync()` whenever the character saves
- Used by character selection UI to show whether a character has a save from the selected world

## Active Map NPC Snapshots
- `MapController.SnapshotActiveNPCs()` serializes live NPCs on active maps without despawning them
- `MapController.ActiveControllers` — static `HashSet` that tracks currently active map controllers
- `MapController.PendingSnapshots` — stores NPC snapshots for init-time consumption during save/load
- `MapController.SpawnNPCsFromPendingSnapshot()` — respawns NPCs from pending snapshots after load
- Ensures NPCs on active (non-hibernated) maps persist through save/load cycles

## Active Map Building Snapshots
- `MapController.SnapshotActiveBuildings()` syncs live buildings into CommunityData without despawning
- Skips preplaced buildings (those with empty `PlacedByCharacterId`)
- `MapController.SpawnSavedBuildings()` respawns player-placed buildings on predefined maps during load
- Both called by SaveManager/GameLauncher during save/load cycles

## GameLauncher
- Singleton coroutine orchestrator for the full game load sequence
- Sets `GameSessionManager` static flags (GameSessionManager does NOT use DontDestroyOnLoad — recreated per scene)
- Loads target scene, waits for player spawn
- Imports the character profile, positions the player via `WorldAssociation`, spawns party NPCs
- Spawns saved buildings on predefined maps via `SpawnSavedBuildings()`
- Shows progress via `ScreenFadeManager.UpdateStatus()` throughout the load sequence
- `ReturnToMainMenuWithError(string)` — handles critical failures, returns to main menu with error overlay
- Entry point: `GameLauncher.Launch()`

## ScreenFadeManager (Overlay System)
- `ShowOverlay(float alpha, string status)` — fades in overlay, blocks input via raycastTarget
- `UpdateStatus(string status)` — updates status text on existing overlay
- `ShowWarning(string warning)` — shows warning text
- `HideOverlay(float fadeDuration)` — fades out overlay
- Used by SaveManager during `RequestSave()` and GameLauncher during load sequence

## SaveManager State Machine
- `SaveLoadState` enum: `Idle`, `Saving`, `Loading` — mutual exclusion prevents concurrent operations
- `RequestSave(Character)` is the single entry point for all save operations
- Coroutine-based: freeze game -> show overlay -> snapshot NPCs + buildings -> serialize ISaveables -> write files -> unfreeze -> hide overlay
- `IsReady` / `OnReady` — settling-based readiness (waits for all ISaveables to register with no new registrations)
- `ResetForNewSession()` — clears registrations, readiness, world info, and state. Also destroys CommunityTracker, WorldOffsetAllocator, BuildingInteriorRegistry, and NetworkManager singletons
- NetworkManager must be explicitly destroyed (NGO auto-applies DontDestroyOnLoad)
- Vector3 serialization requires `ReferenceLoopHandling.Ignore` in JsonSerializerSettings

## Save Triggers
- Bed/sleep: `RequestSave(playerCharacter)`
- Map transition: `RequestSave(playerCharacter)`
- Host shutdown: saves both world + character
- All triggers go through `SaveManager.RequestSave()` which handles world save + character profile save
- Crash/disconnect: no save — revert to last checkpoint

## World Save Menu Flow
- Main Menu → World Select → Character Select → `GameLauncher.Launch()`
- **World creation:** name + optional seed
- **Character creation:** random race/gender/visual (placeholder for future customization)
- **Deletion:** confirmation popup for both worlds and characters via `DeleteConfirmPopup`

## Adding a New Saveable Subsystem
1. Create a DTO class in `Assets/Scripts/Character/SaveLoad/ProfileSaveData/`
2. Implement `ICharacterSaveData<YourDTO>` on the subsystem
3. Set `SaveKey` (unique string) and `LoadPriority` (see table above)
4. Implement `Serialize()` and `Deserialize()`
5. Add bridge methods: `string ICharacterSaveData.SerializeToJson() => CharacterSaveDataHelper.SerializeToJson(this);`
6. Test via ContextMenu on CharacterDataCoordinator: Debug Save/Load

## Party NPC Spawning on Load

GameLauncher handles spawning party NPCs from `CharacterProfileSaveData.partyMembers` during the load sequence:

### Prefab Resolution
- `ResolveCharacterPrefab()` extracts `raceId` from the saved profile's `componentStates` via `ExtractRaceIdFromProfile()` to determine the correct NPC prefab
- `ExtractVisualSeedFromProfile()` extracts the visual seed for appearance reconstruction

### NetworkVariable Pre-Seeding
- `NetworkCharacterId`, `NetworkCharacterName`, `NetworkRaceId`, `NetworkVisualSeed` are set BEFORE `Spawn()` — same pattern as `MapController.WakeUp()` for hibernated NPCs

### Duplication Check
- `Character.FindByUUID()` is called before spawning — if an NPC with the same UUID already exists (e.g., abandoned copy), reconnect instead of spawning a duplicate

### Foreign World Position Handling
- When a party NPC is in a world that is NOT their origin, `CharacterMapTracker.SkipPositionRestore = true` is set before `ImportProfile()`
- This prevents saved position (from a different world) from overriding spawn position near the party leader

### Party Re-Formation
- After all NPCs are spawned and profiles imported, the leader calls `CreateParty()`
- Each NPC then calls `JoinParty()` to reconstruct the party structure

## Abandoned NPC System
- When party leader disconnects: NPCs flagged `IsAbandoned` with `FormerPartyLeaderId`
- Duplicate NPCs can coexist (portal copy + abandoned copy)
- Reclaim interaction: abandoned NPC destroyed, portal copy stays
- `FindByUUID()` prefers non-abandoned; `FindAbandonedByFormerLeader()` for reclaim
