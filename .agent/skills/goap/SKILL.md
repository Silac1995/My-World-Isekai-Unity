# GOAP System

This skill defines how to use and extend the GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning) system. 
**Important:** The GOAP in this project is not just a job queue manager (e.g., Gatherer). It is designed to be the orchestrator of the NPC's **daily life**, based on **ultimate goals**.

## Global Concept: GOAP as a "Life Manager"
GOAP gives the NPC a global and organic direction. Rather than saying "Go chop wood," we give the NPC a life Goal. 

Examples of ultimate goals:
- **Starting a family**: The GOAP Planner will prioritize daily life actions leading to this goal (Talking with NPCs, targeting the opposite sex, flirting, marrying, having children).
- **Being the best martial artist**: The Planner will chain training actions (finding a dojo, fighting opponents, improving on a CombatSO).
- **Financial ambition**: Amassing wealth (which will push them to find a job like Gatherer and deposit resources).

The GOAP manages the long/medium-term plan, while the Behaviour Tree (BT) handles short-term survival (reacting to aggression, fleeing, eating urgently).

## When to use this skill
- To design a new **Life Goal** or new daily action chains (e.g., a seduction cycle, a martial training cycle).
- When creating a `GoapAction` that advances the NPC's personal story (e.g., `Action_Socialize`, `Action_TrainMartialArts`).
- To structure the preconditions and effects linking the NPC's social life, jobs, and needs.

## How to use it

### 1. Create an Ultimate Goal (`GoapGoal`)
A GOAP Goal defines the absolute state the NPC wants to reach in a part of their life.
- `GoalName`: Name of the goal to accomplish (e.g., "StartAFamily").
- `DesiredState`: Dictionary of boolean states describing the success of the goal.
    - Ex: `new Dictionary<string, bool> { { "hasChildren", true } }`
- `Priority`: Priority level of the goal (allows the NPC to choose between training or developing their social circle).

### 2. Define a Life Action (`GoapAction`)
The action is the basic building block of everyday life.
- `ActionName`: String identifying the action.
- `Preconditions`: The necessary state to launch the action.
    - Ex: to have a child, the precondition might be `{"isMarried", true}`.
- `Effects`: The resulting state of the action.
    - Ex: having a child gives the condition `{"hasChildren", true}`.
- `Cost`: The "tediousness" or difficulty of the process (the Planner chooses the least costly route). This cost can vary according to the NPC's "traits"!
- `IsValid`, `Execute`, `IsComplete`, `Exit`: Functions controlling the action frame by frame.

### 3. Planner Logic (`GoapPlanner`)
- It performs a backward search from the Life Goal and finds the logical and daily sequence to accomplish it.
- **Balancing tip**: Set up chains of logical preconditions that force the NPC to live their life (to get married requires a high level of affinity, to have affinity requires the "Socialize" action, etc.).
