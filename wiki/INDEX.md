- [[engine-plumbing]] — status: stable · confidence: medium · covers ~21 subsystems

## People (1)
- [[kevin]] — solo developer, project owner.

## Concepts (1)
- [[unity-ecs]] — Unity ECS / DOTS architecture model; installed (`com.unity.feature.ecs@1.0.0`) but unused yet.

## Projects (0)
_(empty — Spine 2D migration should get its own project page; see memory `project_spine2d_migration`)_

## Decisions / ADRs (1)
- [[adr-0001-living-world-hierarchy-refactor]] — Region → { MapController, WildernessZone, WeatherFront } (accepted 2026-04-21).

## Gotchas (6)
- [[chain-action-isvalid-pre-filter]] — Chain-consumer GOAP actions (`PlantCrop`, `WaterCrop`, `ReturnToolToStorage`) must NOT re-check carry state in `IsValid` — Job-side pre-filter would drop them before the planner can chain `Fetch → Consume`.
- [[dont-clone-prefabs-with-networkobject-for-visuals]] — Cloning a prefab with `NetworkObject` for visual-only purposes silently breaks on clients.
- [[furnituremanager-replace-style-rescan]] — FurnitureManager rescan flow caveat.
- [[host-progressive-freeze-debug-log-spam]] — Ungated `Debug.Log` calls in hot paths cause progressive host freeze on Windows.
- [[static-registry-late-joiner-race]] — Static registries (`TerrainTypeRegistry`, `CropRegistry`, …) are uninitialised on joining clients because `LaunchSequence` is host-only — fix is lazy auto-init in `Get()`.
- [[worldstate-predicate-action-isvalid-divergence]] — `Job._scratchWorldState` predicates (e.g. `hasUnfilledHarvestTask`) MUST mirror the consuming GOAP action's `IsValid` filter exactly — divergence freezes the worker on a goal whose plan can't form.

## Meetings (0)
_(empty)_

## References (1)
- [[unity-ecs-manual]] — Unity Entities 6.4 official manual (mirrored locally at `raw/articles/unity-ecs-manual/`).

## Mechanics (0)
_(empty — promote from wiki/systems/ when individual mechanics grow beyond architecture)_

## Content (0)
_(empty — concrete characters, items, levels, enemies)_

## Pipelines (0)
_(empty — build pipeline, CI, asset pipeline — create as needed)_

## Backlogs
- [[TODO-post-merge]] — 3 pages blocked on feature branch.
- [[TODO-skills]] — 23 systems missing SKILL.md.
- [[TODO-docs]] — 3 missing design docs (NETWORK_ARCHITECTURE.md, pricing model, dialogue MP semantics).

## Orphans

Pages not listed in a section README — none so far (every page is indexed in `systems/README.md` or this index).

## Malformed

None — every page has the required frontmatter (`type`, `title`, `tags`, `created`, `updated`, `sources`, `related`, `status`, `confidence`).
