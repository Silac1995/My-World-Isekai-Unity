# Tool Storage Primitive

## Summary
A generic role assigned to any existing `StorageFurniture`. As of the 2026-05-09 multi-storage refactor, **multiple storages can simultaneously hold the `ToolStorage` role** — workers iterate every tool storage when fetching / returning. The role is **owner-assignable at runtime** via the management panel's `StorageRolesTab` (per-storage dropdown → `ToolStorage`). `CommercialBuilding.ToolStorages` returns the live list; `ToolStorage` (singular) is preserved as a "first-found / convention" helper backed by a two-tier resolver: (Tier 0) any storage child whose runtime `Role == StorageRoleType.ToolStorage`, (Tier 1) first-storage convention fallback (`GetComponentInChildren<StorageFurniture>`). The legacy `_toolStorageFurniture` Inspector field + its snapshot/rebind machinery were removed 2026-05-09 (was dead code — every prefab had `fileID: 0`). Workers fetch tools, use them for a task, return them. Items fetched from a tool storage are stamped with the building's stable `BuildingId` via `ItemInstance.OwnerBuildingId`. The punch-out gate prevents workers (player or NPC) from ending their shift while still carrying a stamped tool — player workers see a UI toast routed through the existing global notification channel.

The primitive is generic and reusable across all worker types. Phase 1 (this rollout) ships it; Plan 3 wires the **Farmer** as the first consumer with a per-task pickup pattern (fetch a watering can, water a cell, return it). Phase 2 (deferred) retrofits Woodcutter / Miner / Forager / Transporter with the **shift-long pickup pattern** (fetch on punch-in, return on punch-out) plus a bag → carry-capacity bonus model.

## Purpose
Adds management gameplay: tool stocking determines parallel work capacity. More watering cans = more parallel waterers; an empty tool storage stalls work and drives a `BuyOrder` for resupply (via the existing logistics chain in [[jobs-and-logistics]]). Without the primitive, "tools" would be implicit / always-available, removing the gameplay tension of "do I buy more axes to scale up the lumber mill?"

## Responsibilities
- Designating a `StorageFurniture` as the tool source for a building (single designer-set field).
- Stamping fetched items with `Building.BuildingId` via `ItemInstance.OwnerBuildingId`.
- Clearing the stamp when the item lands back in its origin storage (GOAP path AND player drop-in path).
- Gating shift-end punch-out via `CharacterJob.CanPunchOut`.
- Notifying player workers of blocked punch-out via a UI toast.
- Auto-returning unreturned tools when a worker quits / is fired / dies.

## Non-responsibilities
- **Does not** manage tool durability or breakage — Phase 2.
- **Does not** model carry-capacity bonuses from bags — Phase 2.
- **Does not** create new furniture types — uses existing `StorageFurniture`.
- **Does not** define which items are "tools" — that's the GOAP action's `toolItem` parameter, set by the calling Job.
- **Does not** auto-stock tool storages — designer pre-stocks at scene authoring; logistics chain via `BuyOrder` (Plan 2 + Plan 3) replenishes.

## Public API / entry points
See [[tool-storage|SKILL.md]] for full method signatures. Headline:
- `building.ToolStorage` (read-only).
- `building.WorkerCarriesUnreturnedTools(worker, out unreturned)`.
- `worker.CharacterJob.CanPunchOut() : (bool, string)`.
- `new GoapAction_FetchToolFromStorage(building, toolItem)` / `new GoapAction_ReturnToolToStorage(building, toolItem)`.
- `instance.OwnerBuildingId` (read/write, persisted).

## Data flow

```
Worker plan needs tool → GoapAction_FetchToolFromStorage(building, tool)
        ├─ IsValid: hands free + storage has matching tool
        ├─ walk to building.ToolStorage (InteractableObject.IsCharacterInInteractionZone gate)
        ├─ take 1 ItemInstance matching tool from storage
        ├─ stamp instance.OwnerBuildingId = building.BuildingId
        └─ equip in HandsController

Worker uses tool (e.g. CharacterAction_WaterCrop in Plan 3) — no plumbing change here.

Worker plan finishes use → GoapAction_ReturnToolToStorage(building, tool)
        ├─ IsValid: hand carries matching tool with matching OwnerBuildingId, storage not full
        ├─ walk to building.ToolStorage
        ├─ remove from hand, AddItem to storage
        └─ AddItem clears OwnerBuildingId via origin-match hook

Schedule transitions Work → non-Work (CharacterSchedule.EvaluateSchedule):
        ├─ CharacterJob.CanPunchOut() — aggregates unreturned tools across all active workplaces
        ├─ if blocked: stay in Work, fire NotifyPunchOutBlockedToClient (player only, rate-limited 30s real-time)
        └─ else: transition normally

CharacterJob.QuitJob (worker quits / is fired / dies):
        ├─ Workplace.WorkerCarriesUnreturnedTools(worker) → list scoped to leaving workplace only
        ├─ TryAutoReturnTools — drop from hand or remove from inventory, AddItem to storage
        └─ Fallback if storage unreachable / full: clear OwnerBuildingId manually + keep in worker inventory ("salvaged")

Player drop-in path (no GOAP):
        Player walks to chest, drops tool via existing UI
        └─ StorageFurniture.AddItem(item) — origin-match hook clears OwnerBuildingId
```

## Dependencies

### Upstream
- [[commercial-building]] — owns the `ToolStorages` list / `ToolStorage` accessor / multi-storage helpers + the `WorkerCarriesUnreturnedTools` helper + the `NotifyPunchOutBlockedClientRpc`.
- [[storage-furniture]] — the actual container; `AddItem` carries the origin-clear hook.
- [[items]] — `ItemInstance.OwnerBuildingId` lives there.
- [[character-job]] — `CanPunchOut` gate caller, `QuitJob` auto-return path.
- [[character-schedule]] — calls `CanPunchOut` on Work→non-Work transitions.

### Downstream
- [[jobs-and-logistics]] — Plan 2 + Plan 3 wire seeds + tools as `IStockProvider` inputs so the logistics chain auto-orders replacements.
- (Future) `JobFarmer` (Plan 3) — first consumer using the per-task pickup pattern for `WateringCan`.
- (Phase 2) `JobHarvester` / `JobTransporter` / `JobBlacksmith` — shift-long pickup retrofit.

## State & persistence

- `ItemInstance.OwnerBuildingId` — string GUID (`Building.BuildingId`), persisted via `JsonUtility` round-trip on the existing inventory + storage save paths. **No new save fields.** Default value on load for pre-existing items: empty string (treated as unowned).
- **Owner-assigned tool storage** — runtime-mutable. The owner picks a `ToolStorage` role on any storage via the management panel; the per-storage `StorageRoleType` field replicates via `StorageFurnitureNetworkSync` and persists in `StorageFurnitureSaveEntry.Role`. See [[commercial-storage-roles]] for the full path. Multiple storages can hold the `ToolStorage` role simultaneously.
- **Convention fallback** — when no storage child has `Role == ToolStorage`, the singleton `ToolStorage` accessor falls back to `GetComponentInChildren<StorageFurniture>()` (first-found). Pre-role-system buildings keep working unchanged. The `ToolStorages` list returns empty in this case; helpers like `FindToolStorageContaining` / `FindToolStorageWithFreeSpace` consult the convention fallback only when the list is empty.

## Known gotchas / edge cases

- **`OwnerBuildingId` MUST stay `[SerializeField]`** — `JsonUtility` skips plain private fields. Removing the attribute would silently drop the field across every save/load. A `// NOTE:` comment in `ItemInstance.cs` documents this.
- **Tool storage destroyed mid-shift** → gate auto-passes; tool stays salvaged. Cosmetic only — periodic cleanup is Phase 2.
- **Storage full at return** → fallback keeps tool in worker inventory, clears stamp. Worker not gated.
- **Cross-map carry** → marker persists; gate only checks current workplace's BuildingId. Re-entering original map re-blocks correctly.
- **Multi-job workers** → `CanPunchOut` aggregates across all active workplaces; `QuitJob` is scoped to the leaving workplace only.
- **`Building.BuildingId` is the stable GUID** (matches `Building.NetworkBuildingId.Value.ToString()`). Renaming the GameObject does NOT break the marker. Do NOT introduce a parallel ID scheme.

## Open questions / TODO

- **Item.asmdef extraction** (testability follow-up): `ItemInstance` lives in `Assembly-CSharp`. EditMode tests touching it need either reflection scaffolding (used in Task 1) or PlayMode tests. Extracting `Assets/Scripts/Item/Item.asmdef` would let tests reference it directly (mirrors `MWI.Farming.Pure` pattern). Captured but deferred — not blocking Plans 1/2/3.
- **NPC owner GOAP for hiring** (Phase 2 placeholder, see also [[commercial-building]] §15 of the spec): when Plan 2 adds owner-controlled hiring, NPCs that own buildings should have GOAP actions to open/close hiring + edit Help Wanted signs. Reuses the same `TryOpenHiring` / `TryCloseHiring` / `TrySetDisplayText` API.

## Change log

- 2026-04-29 — Initial implementation, Plan 1 of 3 in the Farmer rollout. Tasks 1-9 committed across `506adce8` … `43c855a4`. — claude
- 2026-05-08 — Tool storage now uses unified [[commercial-storage-roles]] system: owner-runtime-assignable via management panel `StorageRolesTab`; `_toolStorageFurniture` Inspector field demoted to Tier 1 fallback, owner-assigned `Role == ToolStorage` is Tier 0. Wiring: `CommercialBuilding.ToolStorage` getter checks `GetStoragesWithRole(StorageRoleType.ToolStorage)` first. — claude
- 2026-05-09 — Multi-storage refactor: `ToolStorages` is now a list, multiple storages can hold the `ToolStorage` role simultaneously. Added `FindToolStorageContaining` / `FindToolStorageWithFreeSpace` / `HasToolInAnyToolStorage` / `IsToolStorage` helpers. All consumers iterate (`GoapAction_FetchToolFromStorage`, `GoapAction_ReturnToolToStorage`, `JobFarmer.ProvideWorldState`, `CharacterJob.TryAutoReturnTools`, `StorageFurniture.AddItem` stamp-clear hook, `FindStorageFurnitureForItem`, `GoapAction_GatherStorageItems.DetermineStoragePosition`). The two GOAP cycle actions dropped their `_storageInteractable` cache — silent runtime-rebind bug fix when the role flips mid-plan. — claude
- 2026-05-09 — Removed dead `_toolStorageFurniture` Inspector SerializeField + snapshot/rebind machinery. `ToolStorage` resolver simplified from four tiers to two (role-tagged → first-crate convention). Audit showed every prefab had it as `fileID: 0` — was always-dead code. — claude
